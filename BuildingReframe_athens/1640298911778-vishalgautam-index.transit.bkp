And that's fundamentally what design is about: taking things apart so you can put them back together because obviously taking things apart and walking away is not really going to help. The other thing you find in good designs is that they're always about one or very few things. Designs that survive, designs that really foster reuse are about a single thing, generally. And then you put them together.  So the first thing you do is you take everything apart. Then you compose them, and then you're solving your problem. But the first thing is the taking apart.
